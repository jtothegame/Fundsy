    # TODO:
    # 1- When connecting with external services such as Stripe, it's always
    #    advisable that we handle exception because we're not in control with
    #    what happens on Stripe.
    # 2- This controller action is getting too long so we should into
    #    refactoring it to a common pattern such as: Service Objects
    # 3- We should handle a situation when the user has a already signed up with
    #    us before and created a Stripe Customer so we can just add the card
    #    instead of re-creating the customer on Stripe every time.
